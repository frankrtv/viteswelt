# LLM Documentation

This directory contains official LLM documentation from:

- Svelte 5
- SvelteKit
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

Documentation is automatically fetched and updated using `npm run update-llm-docs`.
Each file has an accompanying `.meta.json` file that tracks its source and last update time.

> Note: Some documentation might not be available if the source doesn't provide LLM-specific docs.
